# 🧠 Oral Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning & IoT

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent system for **early detection of oral cancer** by combining **deep learning techniques** with **IoT-based data acquisition**. The system leverages image-based analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify signs of cancer from oral cavity images, and integrates with IoT devices for real-time monitoring and remote diagnostics.
